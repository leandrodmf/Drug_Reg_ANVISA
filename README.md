## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the Brazilian pharmaceutical market by analyzing data on drug registrations from the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).

ANVISA DATABASE: Medicines Registered in Brazil

> _"The open drug registration database is a data intelligence project that extracts information from the Datavisa system to list products that have been registered by Anvisa, including those whose registration is already valid or canceled/expired, as reported on the Agency's consultation portal."_

> URL: https://dados.gov.br/dados/conjuntos-dados/medicamentos-registrados-no-brasil

The dataset includes information about:
- 'PRODUCT_TYPE';
- 'PRODUCT_NAME';
- 'PROCESS_END_DATE';
- 'REGULATORY_CATEGORY';
- 'PRODUCT_REGISTRATION_NUMBER';
- 'REGISTRATION_EXPIRATION_DATE';
- 'PROCESS_NUMBER';
- 'THERAPEUTIC_CLASS';
- 'REGISTRATION_HOLDER_COMPANY';
- 'REGISTRATION_STATUS';
- 'ACTIVE_INGREDIENT'.

## Project guideline

- How can we use data on drug registrations in Brazil over the years to understand the evolution of the pharmaceutical market?
  
- What the frequency of new drug registrations can reveal in the pharmaceutical market?

- Can we analyze the competitive landscape in the pharmaceutical market? Are able to identify market niches?

## Project Deliverables
